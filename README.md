**Auto Text Gen** is a deep learning-powered application that predicts the next word in a sentence using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks. Trained on a **storyline-based dataset**, the model captures narrative structure and provides intelligent next-word predictions via a **Streamlit web app**.

🔗 **Live Demo**: [https://auto-text-gen.streamlit.app](https://auto-text-gen.streamlit.app)

## 🧠 What It Does

Auto Text Gen reads a partial sentence and predicts the **next likely word** using a language model trained on narrative-style text.

- 📖 Trained on **custom storyline text**
- 🧠 Built with **LSTM** to learn word sequences and dependencies
- 💬 Offers real-time, interactive predictions via a web UI
